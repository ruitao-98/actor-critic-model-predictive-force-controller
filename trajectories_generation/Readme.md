# trajectories_generation

Generate trajectories composed by three types of subtrajectory (line, circle and sine wave), which are then resampled to the desired frequency.
A randomizer allows the randomization choice of the parameters.
Both the generated and the resampled trajectories are saved in the output folder as .csv files.
There is a demo to show how the module works.
