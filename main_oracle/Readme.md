# main_oracle

This folder contains the main scripts of this repository.
In order to launch a test simulation showing the performance of ORACLE, together with the regularizers, refere to the Readme.md in the [script_for_test_oracle](script_for_test_oracle/) folder. In the latter, a script makes usage of a pre-trained neural network ensemble and a pre-generated dataset. If one would like to generate its own dataset and train the ensemble, it should refer to the respective folders [script_for_dataset_generation](script_for_dataset_generation/) and [script_for_nn_training](script_for_nn_training/).
